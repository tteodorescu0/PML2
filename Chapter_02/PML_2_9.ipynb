The bad news is that you tested positive for a serious disease, and that the test is 99% accurate (i.e., the probability of testing positive given that you have the disease is 0.99, as is the probability of testing negative given that you donâ€™t have the disease). The good news is that this is a rare disease, striking only one in 10,000 people. What are the chances that you actually have the disease?
